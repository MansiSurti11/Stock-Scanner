Week 1-2: Planning and Requirements Gathering During the first two weeks of the project, we will gather the requirements from stakeholders, define the scope of the project, and create a detailed project plan. This will involve understanding the user needs, defining the features and functionalities of the application, and creating wireframes and mockups of the user interface.

Week 3-4: API Integration and Data Retrieval In this phase, we will integrate with the financial data APIs to retrieve real-time data for the stocks. We will research and identify the appropriate APIs that can provide the required data and create scripts to fetch the data. We will also create a database to store the data for easy retrieval and manipulation.

Week 5-6: Algorithm Development and Implementation We will develop algorithms to filter the stocks based on user criteria such as price-to-earnings ratio, dividend yield, or market capitalization. We will also create a custom filter that allows users to filter stocks based on their own criteria. We will implement the algorithms in Python and test them thoroughly to ensure that they provide accurate results.

Week 7-8: User Interface Design and Implementation We will design a user-friendly interface for the application that allows users to easily filter stocks based on their requirements. We will use a Python GUI library such as Tkinter or PyQt to implement the interface. We will also integrate the interface with the backend functionality to ensure that users can see the filtered results in real-time.

Week 9-10: Testing and Deployment During this phase, we will test the application thoroughly to ensure that it is bug-free and meets the user requirements. We will create unit tests to test the functionality of the application and ensure that it performs well under different conditions. We will then deploy the application on a cloud-based hosting service such as AWS or Heroku so that it can be accessed by users.
